    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These nachos can be served as a meal, but all the good stuff makes for a great appetizer or snack while watching a game or a quick lunch for your family and friends. 
        Better plan on making two plates of these, they're really good! Serve with sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.</p>

        <li>In a large frying pan, brown ground beef with onion, salt and pepper over medium heat. Break the meat into very small pieces while it is cooking.
